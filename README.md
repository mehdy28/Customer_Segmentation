# Customer_Segmentation
This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and purchasing behavior using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is a collection of customer data from an e-commerce platform.

# Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into smaller groups with similar characteristics or behavior. This can be useful for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.

This project uses machine learning algorithms to identify distinct customer segments based on their characteristics and purchasing behavior. The model is trained on a dataset of customer data and tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Installation
To install this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mehdy28/Customer_Segmentation.git

cd Customer_Segmentation

# Usage
To train the model, run the following command:
Copy code
python train.py
To test the model, run the following command:
Copy code
python test.py

# Data
The dataset used in this project is a collection of customer data from an e-commerce platform. It includes information on demographics, purchasing behavior, and other variables that may be relevant for segmenting customers.

The data was sourced from the company's customer database and has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove any personal identifiers and protect the privacy of the individuals included in the dataset.

# Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a clustering algorithm. The model was trained on a subset of the data and tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.

The model's hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search approach, and the final values chosen were based on the best performance on the validation set.

# Results
The model identified 5 distinct customer segments based on the data. These segments were characterized by different combinations of demographic and purchasing behavior characteristics.

# Future Work
There are several areas for potential future work on this project:
Incorporating additional features or data sources could potentially improve the model's performance.
Using more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning models, may also improve the model's ability to segment customers.
Developing a system for integrating the model's segments into marketing and customer experience strategies.

# Credits
The dataset used in this project was sourced from an e-commerce platform and has been cleaned and preprocessed to protect the privacy of the individuals included in the dataset.
